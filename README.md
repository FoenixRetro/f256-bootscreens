# Foenix-F256JR-bootscreens

This holds text and color 80x60 screen data for the Foenix F256 computers. These are the screens you might be greeted with upon boot (depending on how you have your Foenix configured). 

The "_attrs.bin" files are 80x60 colors, with values corresponding to the included color palette. 
The "_chars.bin" files are the 80x60 text characters, corresponding to the foenix F256 standard font (non-international version). 

The other files in the repo are from lvllvl.com, which is the screen editor used to create these. If you are working in retro computers, you owe it to yourself to check out lvllvl.com! (no, I don't have any association with whomever runs that site, but it is the best I've seen).
